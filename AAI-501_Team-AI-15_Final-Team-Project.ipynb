    "1. **Model Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - **Logistic Regression**: A solid baseline model for text classification, providing competitive results with minimal computation time.\n",
    "   - **SVM**: Robust but computationally expensive, especially for large datasets. Execution could not be completed in some cases.\n",
    "   - **Deep Learning**: Able to capture more complex patterns, though it requires substantial computational power and fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - **TF-IDF**: Proved to be a reliable feature extraction technique, contributing positively to the overall model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Future Directions**:\n",
    "   - Optimize the deep learning model further for better performance.\n",
    "   - Explore additional feature engineering techniques or use advanced embeddings like **Word2Vec** or **BERT** for potentially improved results."
